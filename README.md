===========

This is a software synthesizer for producing hooks like the one found in "Rosa Hellikopter" and other fast-paced dance tracks. It can also produce rock organ sounds or sweeping pads.

Dependencies
------------
* gabi
* mustudio
* synthmod
 
The idea is to build a GUI using Windows API and use sockets + Wine for dealing with the UI.
